# Audio

## Files
* `play-notes.ipynb`: a simple example on how to play a note in a notebook (from [Ann-Marie's post](https://ibm-quantumcomputing.slack.com/archives/C01QKGCF17C/p1619716259010600))
* `notes-from-circuit.ipynb`: splits a circuit by column and plays the notes of each state vector
    * Splits the unit circle into eight parts (each part with angle `pi/4`) and assigns a note (pitch) by rounding to the nearest multiple of `pi/4`
