# Quantum Music Project
The goal of this project is to design an alternative way for anyone interested in quantum computing to experience quantum state evolution through music.

## Features
- Intuitive user interface via Jupyter Notebooks
- Optional tutorial with an overview of Quantum Computing
- Example circuits/audio
- Playground to generate your own audio

## How To
The project is driven through Jupyter Notebooks. If you haven't use Jupyter Notebooks before, here is an overview of [what it is](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) and [how to run them](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html) from the documentation.

Once you are able to run Jupyter Notebooks on your system, you can start running the notebooks in the repository.

## Directory Structure
* `Notebooks/`: code of our learning on Qiskit and audio in a Jupyter Notebook
* `Quantum-Music/`: the Python package for users to use

## Quantum Music Installation/Packaging
To install the `quantum-music` package locally, go to `Quantum-Music/` in this repository, then run:
```
pip install .
```
This will also install other Python packages that are required for `quantum-music` to run.
