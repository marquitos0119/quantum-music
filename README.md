# Quantum Music Project
The goal of this project is to esign an alternative way for anyone interested in quantum computing to experience quantum state evolution through music. 
## Features
- Intuitive user interface via Jupyter Notebooks
- Optional tutorial with an overview of Quantum Computing
- Example circuits/audio
- Playground to generate your own audio
## How To
The project is driven through Jupyter Notebooks. If you haven't use Jupyter Notebooks before, here is an overview of [what it is](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) and [how to run them](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html) from the documentation.

Once you are able to run Jupyter Notebooks on your system, you can start running the notebooks in the repository.
